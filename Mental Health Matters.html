<h1>Matter of the Mind: Why Your Mental Health Matters and How You Can Care for It</h1>
<p>Our mental health has a tremendous impact on our overall health and well-being. Our mental health includes our thoughts, emotions, feelings and moods. It influences our choices, actions and how we relate to others. Good mental health can help us cope with stress, succeed in our professional lives, more effectively recover from difficult situations and add value to our community and be our best self.</p>
<h2>What Exactly is a Mental Illness</h2>
<p>A mental illness is a physical illness of the brain that causes disturbances in thinking, behavior, energy or emotion that make it difficult to cope with the ordinary demands of life. Research is starting to uncover the complicated causes of these diseases which can include genetics, brain chemistry, brain structure, experiencing trauma and/or having another medical condition, like heart disease.</p>

<h2>There are some steps you can take at home and in life to improve mental wellness:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Take care of your body. Exercise can help burn anxious energy, prevent muscle tension, release endorphins that help you feel relaxed, and build strength and endurance which can boost your confidence.</li>
<li>Eat healthy. Avoiding processed and high-fat foods can help prevent lethargic feelings and a lack of motivation, concentration and energy.</li>
<li>Learn a new skill or engage in a new activity. Challenging your brain can result in positive and healthy stimulation and promote mental wellness.</li>
<li>Make time for family and friends. Building and maintaining healthy relationships can go a long way toward long-term mental well-being.</li>
<li>Ensuring that you’re getting the sleep your mind and body needs can help prevent fatigue and ensure you have the energy and mindset to navigate tomorrow.</li>
<li>Meditation can help relax your mind and body. Even one minute of quiet meditation during your workday can make a difference.</li>
<li>Practice deep breathing. Deep breathing gives your brain and muscles necessary oxygen and can help keep your mind and body healthy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Can Do to Help Persons Who Experiences Mental Breakdown</h2>
<ul>
<li>Showing individuals respect and acceptance removes a significant barrier to successfully coping with their illness. Having people see you as an individual and not as your illness can make the biggest difference for someone who is struggling with their mental health.</li>
<li>Advocating within our circles of influence helps ensure these individuals have the same rights and opportunities as other members of your church, school and community.</li>
<li>Learning more about mental health allows us to provide helpful support to those affected in our families and communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, the most important step, as mentioned before, is to talk to a mental health professional if you are struggling with maintaining good mental health. A mental health provider can help you with tips and treatment individualized to your unique needs and circumstances.</p>

<p>Your mental health is a valuable and vital part of your well-being. This National Mental Health Month and all year long, make sure you’re giving it the care and attention it needs so you can be your best self and enjoy all that life has to offer.<p>
